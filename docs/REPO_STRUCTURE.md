# Repo Structure

This template keeps human intent, AI contracts, task state, code, and generated outputs
in different places on purpose.

## Boundary guidance
- `docs/` for intent, plans, decisions, onboarding, prompting guidance, and policy
- `work/` for the active task list, durable learnings, detailed work items, and next-step tracking
- `.codex/` for shared Codex configuration examples and environment notes
- `.agents/skills/` for reusable Codex skills that capture repeatable workflows
- `codex/rules/` for Codex execution-policy rule scaffolding
- `system/` for reusable schemas, templates, prompts, and policy assets
- `prompts/` for runtime prompt assets used by the product
- `evals/` for representative eval cases, rubrics, and grading notes
- `src/` for implementation
- `tests/` for deterministic behavior and regression coverage
- `scripts/` for idempotent repo utilities and automation helpers
- `runtime/` for generated, rebuildable artifacts

## Current project shape
- The canonical product path is a TypeScript web app that will be added in the root tree.
- The current repo still carries template-maintenance Python checks until the product
  scaffold replaces them with stronger app-native verification.
- Scratch worktrees or experiments from other tools are not part of the canonical
  structure and should not live under tracked source paths.

## Practical rules
- If a human or AI must repeatedly read it to stay aligned, it belongs in the repo.
- If work should survive beyond the current session, it belongs in `work/`.
- If Codex should share environment defaults with the team, document them in `.codex/`.
- If one subtree genuinely needs different rules, use `AGENTS.override.md` there.
- If the application sends it to a model at runtime, it belongs in `prompts/` or
  application code.
- If a model behavior matters, its evaluation must live in `evals/`.
- If an output can be regenerated, keep it out of canonical paths and put it in
  `runtime/`.
